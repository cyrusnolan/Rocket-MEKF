# Nsim

This repo houses a 6DOF simulation for a thrust vector controlled lander as well as the my recreation of JPL's G-FOLD
algorithm. This project is the GNC and simulation development necessary to fly Nova and is my final project for ECE5555:
Stochastic Controls and Estimation.

This repository contains two main parts 

  1. GNC code that can be implememted on a flight computer housed in gnc/
  2. Simulation helper function housed in nsim/
